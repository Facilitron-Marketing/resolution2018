description: In which we document the creation of a rock and roll video promo for Resolution.
---

We’ve had a promotional video for both branches of Resolution on our todo list for months now. We finally bit the bullet and put one together last week. It’s a rock and roll promo, so turn up your volume and hit the play button. Then check out the dirty details of how the sausage was made.

### A pencil and a notebook &#128221;

I’m a fan of writing things down before sitting down at a keyboard. I’ve found that it’s easier for me to get my thoughts down quickly and not get caught up in the minutiae of pixels and alignment.

Because of that, I’ve developed a fetish for notebooks. I’ve bought dozens, but have finally settled on Field Notes.

They are portable and disposable, which means that I don’t have any reservations about actually using them. All of the beautiful journals I’ve had in the past have been left blank because I felt that I had to have the perfect sketches, lyrics, etc. Not so with these. As an added bonus, they are made by one of our design crushes, Aaron Draplin. We have a subscription and every package from them feels like Christmas.

Here are my initial storyboard sketches. Fancy, huh? I’m not always this messy with my sketches.

### Promo video storyboard &#128253;
I knew that I was going to animating in Adobe After Effects, and I knew that After Effects and Illustrator play nicely together, with some caveats. I also knew that I wanted to use the vector illustrations we’ve been using on the site, so Illustrator was an easy choice.

Here is the final storyboard.

### Preparing to animate
After assembling the rough storyboards in one document, I exported each artboard as a separate Illustrator file for further preparation.

After Effects imports Illustrator files in a few different ways, only one of which is actually helpful. I knew that I wanted to animate different elements of each illustration, which meant that I first needed to separate each element onto separate layers.

I opened each artboard and created named layers for each element to be animated. That process is tedious and boring, but so necessary.

Once that was complete, I imported the Illustrator files as a composition retaining layer sizes and I was off to the races.

### After Effects is rad
I wasn’t familiar with After Effects before this project, but I’ve always been one to jump into the river to see how tall I am. I had a decent amount of experience with timelines from my work in Flash and Premiere and figured that it couldn’t be that hard. I was mostly right.

After Effects makes it easy to keyframe properties like position, scale, and opacity. But certain things that I knew that I wanted like syncing the animation to the kick or snare of the music was beyond my capabilities. Luckily, there are extensions to After Effects that help.

I used Sound Keys to map the kick, snare, and key frequencies from the interlude onto keyframes. I was then able to give that map custom range of values and used the pick-whip to scale elements to those values. Et voila – animation that matched the music.

I wound up creating the entire video in one composition because I couldn’t figure out how to synch the audio into pre-compositions. I’ll figure that out next time. Here is half of the final timeline:

### Wrapping up &#128190;

I posted this to socials claiming that it took me 9000 hours in MSPaint. In reality, it took about 10 hours and that included frequent research breaks. I learned a ton and have already begun a promo video for Resolution Healthcare.

Until next time, we love you! &#128140;
