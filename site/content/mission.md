### We are Proud to Represent Resolution

We are a new firm, we are a different firm, we are a better firm. We are here because we love what we do and we enjoy a deep satisfaction by doing it well.

### We are Proud of our Work

No project leaves Resolution unless we would use it to represent ourselves.

### We are not Pretty-Makers

Our primary service is our thinking. Strategy comes first, design follows.

### Our Clients are our Partners

The success of our clients is our success. We’ve been hired to provide them with the best opportunity to succeed. They are collaborators working towards a mutual win. Because we represent one another, we are careful in our client selection.

### One True Process

The strength of our results is determined by the commitment to our process. The process is a living document, it evolves as we evolve.

### Communication is Key

In relationships internal and external, we strive to maintain excellent communication. Additionally, all viewpoints are openly considered — we may not always get our way, but our voice will always be heard.

### We are Devoted to Continuous Improvement

As a team and as individuals, we strive to better ourselves.
