      <h1>Adventures in After Effects</h1>
      

<p>We’ve had a promotional video for both branches of Resolution on our todo list for months now. We finally bit the bullet and put one together last week. It’s a rock and roll promo, so turn up your volume and hit the play button. Then check out the dirty details of how the sausage was made.</p>

<h3 id="a-pencil-and-a-notebook-128221">A pencil and a notebook &#128221;</h3>

<p>I’m a fan of writing things down before sitting down at a keyboard. I’ve found that it’s easier for me to get my thoughts down quickly and not get caught up in the minutiae of pixels and alignment.</p>

<p>Because of that, I’ve developed a fetish for notebooks. I’ve bought dozens, but have finally settled on Field Notes.</p>

<p>They are portable and disposable, which means that I don’t have any reservations about actually using them. All of the beautiful journals I’ve had in the past have been left blank because I felt that I had to have the perfect sketches, lyrics, etc. Not so with these. As an added bonus, they are made by one of our design crushes, Aaron Draplin. We have a subscription and every package from them feels like Christmas.</p>

<p>Here are my initial storyboard sketches. Fancy, huh? I’m not always this messy with my sketches.</p>

<h3 id="promo-video-storyboard-128253">Promo video storyboard &#128253;</h3>

<p>I knew that I was going to animating in Adobe After Effects, and I knew that After Effects and Illustrator play nicely together, with some caveats. I also knew that I wanted to use the vector illustrations we’ve been using on the site, so Illustrator was an easy choice.</p>

<p>Here is the final storyboard.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-to-animate">Preparing to animate</h3>

<p>After assembling the rough storyboards in one document, I exported each artboard as a separate Illustrator file for further preparation.</p>

<p>After Effects imports Illustrator files in a few different ways, only one of which is actually helpful. I knew that I wanted to animate different elements of each illustration, which meant that I first needed to separate each element onto separate layers.</p>

<p>I opened each artboard and created named layers for each element to be animated. That process is tedious and boring, but so necessary.</p>

<p>Once that was complete, I imported the Illustrator files as a composition retaining layer sizes and I was off to the races.</p>

<h3 id="after-effects-is-rad">After Effects is rad</h3>

<p>I wasn’t familiar with After Effects before this project, but I’ve always been one to jump into the river to see how tall I am. I had a decent amount of experience with timelines from my work in Flash and Premiere and figured that it couldn’t be that hard. I was mostly right.</p>

<p>After Effects makes it easy to keyframe properties like position, scale, and opacity. But certain things that I knew that I wanted like syncing the animation to the kick or snare of the music was beyond my capabilities. Luckily, there are extensions to After Effects that help.</p>

<p>I used Sound Keys to map the kick, snare, and key frequencies from the interlude onto keyframes. I was then able to give that map custom range of values and used the pick-whip to scale elements to those values. Et voila – animation that matched the music.</p>

<p>I wound up creating the entire video in one composition because I couldn’t figure out how to synch the audio into pre-compositions. I’ll figure that out next time. Here is half of the final timeline:</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up-128190">Wrapping up &#128190;</h3>

<p>I posted this to socials claiming that it took me 9000 hours in MSPaint. In reality, it took about 10 hours and that included frequent research breaks. I learned a ton and have already begun a promo video for Resolution Healthcare.</p>

<p>Until next time, we love you! &#128140;</p>
