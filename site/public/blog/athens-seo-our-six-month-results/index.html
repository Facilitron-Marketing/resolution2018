      <h1>How we nailed Athens SEO in 6 months</h1>
      

<p>We&rsquo;ve been experimenting with on-site SEO for <a href="https://resolutionathens.com">resolutionathens.com</a>. We&rsquo;ve learned a lot and had some pretty incredible results.</p>

<p>Before last year, Resolution thrived as an Athens graphic design firm for nearly 25 years—solely on word of mouth and referrals.</p>

<p>We never had a website before mid-summer of 2016. We never advertised. For many years we operated without so much as a sign on the door. In my mind, this is the ultimate testament to Taylor’s talent as a graphic designer and the attention he gives to his clients.</p>

<p>However, when I signed on and brought web design to the firm, it soon became apparent that if we wanted web clients, we had to let people know that we were here and offering web design and development as a service. If you’ve read any of our blog posts on strategy, content, or web design, then you know that our lens on digital marketing is summed up simply: Your website is the online face of your business and potentially your most powerful marketing tool.</p>

<p>We needed to do for ourselves what we promise to do for our clients. And so we began working on search engine optimization in January of this year.</p>

<p>Our strengths at Resolution are: brand strategy, graphic design, web design, print design, marketing, and content marketing. While we offer more services, these were the ones we decided to tackle out of the gate. Because we love Athens and sincerely want to help local Athens businesses succeed, we specifically set out to improve our Athens SEO.</p>

<p>Our target keywords became “brand strategy athens”, “graphic design athens”, “web design athens”, “content marketing athens”, “design agency athens”, and “digital agency athens”. These were the phrases we would track. On each of these we started at ground zero—no search results.</p>

<p>It felt ambitious to target all six keywords at once. Could we make it to the first page of Google? Could we do it within six months?</p>

<p>As it turns out, yes, we could, on both counts. Here are screenshots of our results as of August 30, 2017, click each to see the full image.</p>

<h2 id="our-seo-process">Our SEO process</h2>

<p>Getting these results was time consuming and took a lot of effort, but the process itself was simple. We used no black magic, just old-fashioned elbow-grease.</p>

<ol>
<li>Research our target keywords.</li>
<li>Create relevant content around those keywords.</li>
<li>Track our progress.</li>
<li>Iterate on our efforts.</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat.</li>
</ol>

<p>There were a couple of other efforts.</p>

<p>We cleaned up any mentions of Resolution around the web, taking care that our name, address, and phone number were consistent.</p>

<p>And we worked hard to optimize our site for speed and mobile friendliness.</p>

<p>Granted, Athens is a small town and it would no doubt take us longer to have the same results in Atlanta. But the keywords we hit faced stiff competition from Athens design firms and advertising agencies that have had their websites for ten plus years.</p>

<p>Is Resolution the best web design and development firm in Athens? That’s our goal. We aim to accomplish that goal by fulfilling our promise of better strategy, better design, and better results for our clients.</p>

<p>As always, if you are looking to elevate your business and achieve better results from your marketing and advertising, give us a call.</p>

<p>Until next time, we love you! &#128140;</p>
