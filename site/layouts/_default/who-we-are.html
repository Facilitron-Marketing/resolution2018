        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <h3>20+ Years of excellence</h3>
        <p>
          Taylor opened doors under the name Resolution Digital Type and Image in 1993 with an AGFA imagesetter and a dream. He quickly became the preferred prepress and design partner of many local and regional businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly but surely the word got out that Resolution provided great graphic design in addition to prepress and Taylor built a loyal base of happy clients. He ran Resolution as a very successful one-man shop specializing in print design and production without so much as a sign on the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twenty years later, there was a homecoming of sorts when Ian returned to Resolution as a partner and brought all he had learned about advertising, marketing, web design, and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, they re-envisioned Resolution and set out on a mission to provide the best websites and graphic design possible to results-driven clients. Today they operate as a full-service design agency intent on getting real results for their clients.
