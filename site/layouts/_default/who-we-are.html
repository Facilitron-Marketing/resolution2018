        <h2>Strategists</h2>
        <h3>Begin at the beginning</h3>
        <p>Businesses often confuse strategy and tactics. Strategy takes a deep and overarching look at the problem, gives it a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and an action plan. Tactics are the steps in executing your plan.</p>

          Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat. &mdash; Sun Tzu

        <h3>You look good</h3>
        <p>Graphic design is the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content. Though we pride ourselves on creating aesthetically pleasing layouts, we believe that the purpose of design is to communicate your story in a compelling manner to your target audience.</p>

        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <h3>20+ Years of excellence</h3>
        <p>
          Taylor opened doors under the name Resolution Digital Type and Image in 1993 with an AGFA imagesetter and a dream. He quickly became the preferred prepress and design partner of many local and regional businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly but surely the word got out that Resolution provided great graphic design in addition to prepress and Taylor built a loyal base of happy clients. He ran Resolution as a very successful one-man shop specializing in print design and production without so much as a sign on the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twenty years later, there was a homecoming of sorts when Ian returned to Resolution as a partner and brought all he had learned about advertising, marketing, web design, and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, they re-envisioned Resolution and set out on a mission to provide the best websites and graphic design possible to results-driven clients. Today they operate as a full-service design agency intent on getting real results for their clients.
