          <p>&ldquo;<strong>We couldn't have been happier working with everyone at Resolution</strong>. They earned our respect during the first meeting by arriving well-prepared and actively listening to our story. As the project moved forward, communication with the Resolution team was impeccable. Resolution delivered our website on time and exceeded our very high expectations with their passion and quality of work.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>&ldquo;<strong>I absolutely ADORE working with Resolution for our graphic design needs</strong>. The work they produce is always exactly what we have in mind (if not better than we imagined), and they manage to do so with very little direction from us. They pay close attention to the small details and do their research to make sure we get the best product. Taylor has been my hero more times than I can count, and I recommend him to everyone!&rdquo;</p>

          <p>&ldquo;<strong>It is always a pleasure to work with Taylor Little at Resolution</strong>. He pays attention to detail and produces great work. He is kind and patient and works with you until your project is just right. Though we’ve never met face-to-face, I feel like I’ve gotten to know Taylor well through our correspondence. He’s a skilled graphic designer who I would recommend to anyone.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>&ldquo;<strong>Resolution anticipated our needs at every stage</strong> and helped us discover things we didn’t know we needed. The approval stages meant that we knew that we were going to get exactly what we wanted. The result speaks for itself: a wonderfully functional site with a great design.&rdquo;</p>

We have found him to be creative, willing to incorporate our ideas and suggestions, meet our deadlines, and design pieces that are very effective in telling our story. <strong>To sum it up, we love working with Taylor</strong>!&rdquo;</p>
